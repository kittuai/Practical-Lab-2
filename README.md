## About the Assignment

This notebook was developed for **Lab 2: Multivariate Regression and Non-Parametric Models**, a practical component of the Machine Learning Programming course. The lab focuses on building and comparing different regression models using the **Scikit-learn Diabetes dataset**, with special attention to:

- Understanding and applying multiple modeling techniques:
  - Univariate Polynomial Regression
  - Multivariate Polynomial Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - k-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (kNN)
- Evaluating models using key regression metrics:
  - RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- Using a consistent trainâ€“validationâ€“test split
- Writing clean, beginner-friendly Python code with professional structure and clear inline comments
- Presenting visual insights to support interpretation and analysis

## Problem Framing & Final Model Insights

The primary objective was to predict the **progression of diabetes** in patients based on 10 input features from the Scikit-learn Diabetes dataset. The problem was framed as a supervised regression task.

After training and evaluating all models, the following observations were made:

- **Univariate Polynomial Regression** captured nonlinear trends but was limited by using only one feature.
- **Multivariate Polynomial Regression** improved performance slightly but was prone to overfitting with higher degrees.
- **Decision Tree Regressor** offered strong interpretability and handled nonlinearity well, but was sensitive to depth and prone to variance.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors** provided smooth predictions but required careful tuning of the number of neighbors.

ðŸ“Œ **Best Performing Model:**  
Based on the RÂ² score and error metrics across validation and test sets, the **Decision Tree Regressor** emerged as the most effective model, striking a balance between accuracy and interpretability for this dataset.
